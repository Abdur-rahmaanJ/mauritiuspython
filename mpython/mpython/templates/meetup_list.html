        <h3>Monthly Meetups</h3>
        <p>
        Our python meetup is more of a social event than technical one. We welcome everyone to join our meetups. If you are a Python hacker, come to showcase your Python projects, to exchange your Python experiences, tips or jokes; if you are a startup founder looks for coders or technical advises, come and talk nerdy to us; if you are simply curious about Python or programming languages in general, we will tell you what Python can do for you. It's a friendly & relax environment to expand your knowledge about Python. Occasionally, we will have guests to give a talk or two! You can check the details below, or subscribe our newsletter to be informed for future meetups.
